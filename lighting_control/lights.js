// Welcome to lighting control
// controlling Christmas lights is going to be an important part of this app
// The shorcut should be cl (control lights)
// When you ask to control lights, you will get multiple options
// The options returned could be in most used order - only 3 can be shown on the normal cards for facebook - useful if the top ones were here
// Could be good to use a different sort of prompt e.g. on facebook the scrolling carousel at the bottom
// This is an example of an action that will have meta data
// Action = /control-lighting/
// Metadata = a number representing the setting on the lights
// The metadata will be associated with the names of the functions on the lights
// When the endpoint for the setting is hit it will trigger an arduino controller to automatically reset the IC and then click through the number of times representing the setting

// Themes of work
// (PRIORITY)
// Routing
// Facebook
// Controlling the lights

// (NEXT STEPS)
// App control panel
// Associating specific lights - maybe? - might need a double metadata
