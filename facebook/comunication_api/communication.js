// This will need to do all of the stuff to align facebook to the app
// This will make requests to the app api so that the server can do stuff
// After each endpoint is hit and a post request is made a response will be sent to the user
// Doing this will mean that things shouold all just work
// This part of the system will also be responsible dealing with the routes in the routing table
// Only do things on end of action - either meta is false - action ends or meta is true and data is provided (couold be more complex and require multipl emeta in future) - this is a simplification
